- Gadolinium is not visualized on MRI, but instead facilitates, the relaxation of hydrogen, protons in water
- Is itself toxic, but because it is bound to a specific chelating agent it is safe for use
- When acute infarct/inflammation,
	- Rupture of cellular membrane.
	- Cellular swelling and edema.
	- Gadolinium enters the extracellular space and clears slowly.
		- Gadolinium loves collagen and globs onto it
- Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) shorten the T1 relaxation time of the surrounding tissues proportional to the local gadolinium concentration. In normal state, gadolinium, which is a large, high-density element made metabolically inert by chelation, enters the extracellular space readily after intravascular injection, but it is unable to cross the cell membrane of a normal myocyte. However, when the myocyte cell membrane is damaged (eg, acute MI) or if there is an increase in the extracellular space between myocytes (eg, acute interstitial edema or chronic fibrosis or MI), GBCA accumulates in the extracellular space, and its washout is delayed after the injection.

	- Thus, areas of abnormal myocardium (eg, infarcted, fibrotic, inflamed, or infiltrated myocardium) will have elevated per-voxel GBCA concentration and therefore will have a bright signal on T1-weighted images relative to the surrounding normal myocardium.
