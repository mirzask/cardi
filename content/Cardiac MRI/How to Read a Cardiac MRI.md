- Open cvi42 application
- On left pane 'Viewer' is your homebase
- 3 groups of MRI images (in order)
	- Echo-like images
	- 
- Start reading your scout images and assess extra-cardiac findings
- `_trufi` sequence on Siemens good contrast b/w blood pool (bright ðŸ”† blood) and myocardium
	- Gated images
- Function Biplanar LAX can auto-calculate stuff for you
- `Shift+Right click` for window/level
- `Alt+R` to rotate images
	- Orme used this to get anterior wall on SAX at 12 o'clock
- Flow
	- On Left pane select, `Flow 2D`
	- Select flow images â†’ drag them in
	- See Total Forward Volume, Total Backward Volume, etc.
	- Load aortic and pulmonary flows â†’ Click 'Comparison' â†’ Will automatically calculate a Qp/Qs for you
- `_vibe_`
	- Measurements of aorta, look at pulmonary veins, etc.
	- "poor man's CTA"
- MPR View
	- Only works with certain sequences
- 4D flow is free breathing
	- We use Arterys (now under Tempus)
	- Can use to calculate Qp/Qs as well
- High TI imaging is great to see clot/thrombus, which will appear dark/black âš«
- `tiscout` to pick where myocardium is darkest/blackest. ti-scout to identify the time when the myocardium is nulled
	- Amyloid never nulls
	- "Normal myocardial nulling argues against [[Amyloidosis]]"
	- Phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) lets the computer try to figure it out. Try if can't null and see if computer can figure it out.

# Measure ventricle size

- Left panel, select `Function SAX`
- Pull in `cine_trufi_* SAX stack`
- Pull in cross reference views in the smaller two windows
- Find diastole (and systole) to correspond to your measurements of interest
- SV between LV and RV should be +/- 10 mL
	- not accounting for regurgitation, etc.
