- Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a wide complex arrhythmia of ventricular origin, defined as <u>â‰¥ 3 consecutive beats</u> at a rate of more than 100 beats per minute. 
- *Sustained* VT is defined as tachycardia that continues for <u>> 30 seconds or leads to hemodynamic compromise within 30 seconds</u>. 
- Non-sustained VT (NSVT) lasts <u>less than 30 seconds and does not cause hemodynamic instability</u>.
- On the basis of QRS morphology, VT is divided into **monomorphic** and **polymorphic** ventricular tachycardia. [^pearls]
- **Monomorphic VT**
	- characterized by a single, stable QRS morphology with no beat-to-beat variation [^pearls]
- **Polymorphic VT**
	- characterized by beat-to-beat variation in QRS shape and multiple QRS morphologies. [^pearls]
	- [[Torsades de Pointes]] is a form of **polymorphic VT** that occurs in the setting of the long QT interval, characterized by waxing and waning of QRS amplitude, giving it the name "twisting of the points." [^pearls]
	- **Bidirectional VT** is another form of **polymorphic VT** and has a characteristic beat-to-beat change in the QRS axis. [^pearls]
		- Commonly seen in the setting of digitalis toxicity and patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). [^pearls]
- Accelerated atrioventricular rhythm (AIVR) is a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, referred to as a sign of successful reperfusion, and it has a strong association with infarct size. [^pearls]
- DDx includes ischemic heart disease (most common cause), ischemic/non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, adultÂ and congenital structural heart disease, inherited cardiac channelopathies, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia), illicit drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine, and digitalis toxicity. [^pearls]
- RR intervals are usually regular (but may be irregular).
- In VT, capture/fusion complexes result when a P wave occurs at the appropriate timing to allow for conduction through the AV node with at least partial capture of the ventricles. When seen, these complexes help establish the presence of [[AV dissociation]] (independent atrial and ventricular rhythms).
- Work-up should include a 12-lead ECG in sinus rhythm
	- helps diagnose the underlying cause of ventricular tachycardia, e.g., myocardial ischemia/infarction, long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, and [[Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)|ARVC]]. [^pearls]

# Electrocardiogram (ECG) for VT

- **Wide R-R interval**
	- **Monomorphic VT**: width unchanged
	- **Polymorphic VT**: width is more variable. If the intervals are not the same or irregular?
- VT should *not* be irregular, if it is, then you should think of [[Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)]] or Pre-excited AFib/[[Wolff Parkinson White]]
- ECG Findings that support Dx of VT
	- Capture beats (also known as Dressler beats)
	- [[Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)#Fusion Complexes|Fusion complexes]]
	- Precordial concordance (positive/negative)
	- [[AV Dissociation]]
	- aVR criteria (extreme/northwest axis deviation)
	- R-to-S interval > 100 ms in precordial leads

## Fusion Complexes

- The P-wave preceding the fusion complex is often easy to identify and can then be â€œmarched outâ€œ to identify other P waves associated with the atrial rhythm. This may be useful to identify [[AV dissociation]].

## Brugada Criteria

Original paper ðŸ“„ [^brugada]

1. Is there AV dissociation (independent P/QRS, capture beats, fusion beats)?
	1. Yes = VT
	2. Do the P waves march out?
2. If no, is there an RS in any precordial lead (V1-V6)?
	1. No = VT
	2. You have to have absence of RS complex in all 6, i.e. if you see an RS complex in any precordial lead, then this criteria is not satisfied
3. If yes, is QRS onset to nadir of S wave > 100 msec in any precordial lead?
	1. Yes = VT
	2. Caveat: rate-related aberrancy â†’ at faster HR bundle can fool you into thinking it's wider than it really is
4. If no, are there morphologic criteria* for VT in both V1 and V6?
	1. Yes = VT
5. If no, Supraventricular tachycardia

## Basel Algorithm

- Original paper ðŸ“„ [^basel]
- Wide-Complex Tachycardia â†’ Algorithm to differentiate [[Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)]] from [[Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)]]
- [[Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)]] is Dx with â‰¥ 2 of the following criteria:
	- clinical high risk features
	- lead II time to first peak >40 ms
	- lead aVR time to first peak >40 ms
- If 0 or 1 criteria met only â†’ Dx is [[Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)]]
- ![[Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)-20241223145000442.webp]]
- Similar performance to Brugada algorithm; outperformed [[Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)#Vereckie Algorithm|Vereckei algorithm]]
	- this Basel algorithm was developed b/c of low reproducibility of these other algorithms


# Mimickers

## [[Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)|SVT]] with [[Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB)|RBBB]] Aberrancy

> This example: Only wide in V1, V2 because hx of RBBB. Other leads, QRS is narrow.

![[Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)-20241223145204164.webp]]


> This example: Without baseline ECG you could get tricked. The axis is northwest (negative in I, negative in II, aVF, negative in aVR). The reason this is SVT with aberrancy is because the axis didn't change from baseline. If you look at the baseline ECG, then you see they had northwest axis to begin with.
