> [!hint] Rule of Thumb: Atrial and Ventricular Rates
> When the atrial rate is *faster* than the ventricular rate (and no atrial rates are conducted), CHB is present. If the ventricular rate is faster than the atrial rate, [[AV dissociation]] *without* CHB should be suspected.


- Involves a complete block of the conduction of atrial stimuli to the ventricles → so atrial depolarizations are _not_ conducted to the ventricles. Therefore, an automaticity focus below the complete block <u>escapes</u> to pace the ventricles at its inherent rate.
- Perfusing rhythm (if present) is maintained by **junctional** or **ventricular** escape rhythm.
- Distal/infranodal 3˚ AVB is much more likely to produce Sx than 3˚ AVB located in the AV node.[^fogoros]
- ECG: 
	- [[AV dissociation]] w/ independent atrial and ventricular rates
	- **A** going at one rate and **V** going at another rate (both at stable rates, i.e. regular P-P interval and regular R-R interval)
	- If CHB localized to the AV node:
		- usually accompanied by relatively reliable escape pacemaker, localized just distally to the AV node ("high junctional" escape rhythm). Often yields a baseline HR of 40-55 bpm and responds (at least moderately well) to ↑ sympathetic tone.[^fogoros]

		- You often see this pattern where the CHB is usually localized to the AV node with **congenital** CHB too.
	- If CHB localized distal to the AV node (infranodal):
		- wide-complex, slow (20-40 bpm) escape pacemaker is a strong indicator of distal/infranodal AVB
			- by contrast, a narrow-complex and more rapid (40-55 bpm) escape rhythm suggests AV nodal block

- Evaluation:
	- BP - check for hypOtension, HD instability
	- QRS
		- if wide, suggests _escape_ rhythm (bad!)
			- May need to get the dopamine going and begin coordinating for pacing
		- if narrow, good (*relatively*)
	- Syncope - bad if present
- Treatment
	- Pacemaker
	- Consider temporary pacemaker until permanent pacemaker is implanted
