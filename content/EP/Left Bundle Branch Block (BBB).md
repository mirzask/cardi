>The Mean QRS Vector, “Axis”, and [[Ventricular Hypertrophy]] cannot be determined accurately in the presence of Bundle Branch Block.

- RBBB and LBBB are specific varieties of **interventricular conduction delay (IVCD)**
	- Caused by a block (of conduction) in the Right or in the Left Bundle Branch. The blocked Bundle Branch delays depolarization to the ventricle that it supplies.
- QRS > 0.12 secs, i.e. > 3 small squares

![[Left Bundle Branch Block (BBB)-20241220132421455.webp]]

- LBBB almost immediately divides into 3 fascicles after splitting off from the His bundle. Hence, why if you see LBBB, it suggests a diffuse pathological process instead of a localized one.
- LBBB itself causes disordered LV contraction and in patients with poor systolic function, can worsen cardiac performance. (See [[Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)]])
	- In patients with LBBB and [[Heart Failure]], [[Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)|CRT]] can help recoordinate ventricular contractions
- Prognosis:
	- Younger patients with LBBB usually have no underlying heart disease, i.e. excellent prognosis
	- Older patients, LBBB usually indicates presence of progressive heart disease (most commonly CAD, CM, or [[Valvular Heart Disease|valvular heart disease]])
- Widened, R-R' appearance detected in leads V5 and V6
# Complete versus Incomplete

- **Complete LBBB** 
	- QRS duration ≥120 ms
	- Broad notched or slurred R wave in lateral leads (I, aVL, V5, and V6) and an occasional RS pattern in V5 and V6 attributed to displaced transition of QRS complex
	- Absent Q waves in leads I, V5, and V6, but in the lead aVL, a narrow Q wave may be present in the absence of myocardial pathology
	- R peak time >60 ms in leads V5 and V6 but normal in leads V1, V2, and V3, when small initial R waves can be discerned in the precordial leads
	- ST and T waves usually opposite in direction to QRS
- **Incomplete LBBB**
	- QRS duration between 110-119 ms
	- [[Left Ventricular Hypertrophy|LVH]] pattern
	- R peak time >60 ms in leads V4, V5, and V6
	- Absence of Q wave in leads I, V5, and V6
