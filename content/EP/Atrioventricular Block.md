- Determining whether a patient needs a pacemaker depends on 3 things:
	- is the conduction disorder producing **symptoms**?
	- the **site** of the conduction disorder
		- block in the AV node (proximal block) is usually benign, whereas block in the His-Purkinje system (infranodal) is potentially lethal
	- the **degree** of the conduction block
		- 1˚ and 2˚ AV block tend to be asymptomatic

- ==If heart block is less than complete (i.e. first- or second-degree), it is still important to pinpoint the site of block to either the AV node (nodal) or the His–Purkinje system (infranodal).== If in the AV node, it tends to be benign and non-progressive.  If distal to the AV node (infranodal), it tends to progress to a higher degree of block; prophylactic pacing is often indicated.[^fogoros]
	- Infranodal block is potentially life-threatening. This is largely d/t the unreliable, unstable, and slow escape pacemakers that tend to accompany this condition. Often discharge irregularly at a rate of 20-40 bpm and are prone to fail altogether.
	- Infranodal block tends to be chronic and progressive in nature, i.e. *not* transient/reversible.
- You can often use the fact that the AV node has rich autonomic innervation in the His-Purkinje system to your advantage when trying to identify the site of the block when examining the surface ECG. [^fogoros]
	- maneuvers that ↓ vagal tone or ↑ sympathetic tone → expected to improve AV nodal block, but *not* distal block
	- maneuvers that ↑ vagal tone or ↓ sympathetic tone → worsen AV nodal block, but *not* distal block

<center>Non-invasive differentiation of AV nodal and infranodal block</center>

|                        | AV nodal | Infranodal                  |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Exercise/isoproterenol | Improves | Conduction ratio may worsen |
| Atropine               | Improves | Conduction ratio may worsen |
| Vagal maneuvers        | Worsens  | No change                   |
| [[Beta Blockers]]      | Worsens  | No change                   |


- Causes
	- Ischemia or infarction
		- the RCA gives off the AV nodal artery in ~90% of patients (inferior MI)
			- tends to be transient
		- LAD or anterior infarct tends to be associated with distal/infranodal AV block
			- tends to be chronic and progressive
	- Acute [[Rheumatic heart disease|rheumatic fever]] and other cardiac inflammatory conditions
	- Drugs, e.g. [[Digoxin|digoxin]], [[Beta Blockers|BBs]], [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]]
		- typically the drug will cause 1˚ AVB and higher degree block suggests underlying intrinsic AV nodal dysfunction
- 2:1 block
	- 2 P waves for every QRS complex
	- 📝 when you have 2:1 block, often can't tell if Type I or Type II
		- Clues to help differentiate Type I and II:
			- QRS > 120 ms, e.g. RBBB morphology → you know conduction disease, which pushes you to Type II
		- Exercise them, Wake them up and walk around → if conduction better then Type I. If worse (e.g. 2:1 → 3:1), then Type II.
		- Carotid sinus massage and it goes from 2:1 → 1:1 conduction, it is Type II.
			- carotid massage → ↑ vagal tone → conduction better b/c enough time to conduct every one of those beats
			- If Type I, it should get *worse*
		- Isoproterenol

# First degree (1˚) AV Block

- All atrial impulses are transmitted to the ventricles, but the conduction times are prolonged → ↑ PR interval
	- lengthens the delay between atrial and ventricular depolarization
- **prolonged** [[PR interval]] that is *consistently prolonged* by the same amount in every cycle
	- > 0.2 secs, i.e. > 1 large box
- In most patients with 1˚ AVB, the slow conduction is localized to the AV node. Although less common, 1˚ AV block may be distal/infranodal, but still tends to be asymptomatic.[^fogoros]

# Second degree (2˚) AV Block

- On ECG, some P waves are followed by QRS complexes, and others are not.
- ==Symptoms are largely dependent on the **ventricular rate**.==
- The Mobitz classification helps to localize the site of the 2˚ AVB.[^fogoros]
- Autonomic maneuvers can be used to distinguish between AV nodal vs. distal/infranodal block if Type 1 or 2:1 AVB:
	- If AV nodal block, exercise/atropine will improve/resolve the block
	- If distal block, exercise/atropine will *not* improve the block and may actually worsen the block, e.g. 2:1 → 3:1 (or higher)

> [!warning] Cannot use Mobitz classification in 2:1 AV block
> You cannot use the Mobitz classification with 2:1 AV block (by definition). Many clinicians make the mistake of automatically classifying 2:1 block as Mobitz Type 2, i.e. misdiagnose 2:1 AVB as distal block. **When 2:1 block present, use another classification besides Mobitz to deduce the site of the block**.[^fogoros]


## Mobitz Type 1 (aka Wenckebach)

> [!tip] Detecting Mobitz Type 1 on ECG
> The best way to tell that the Mobitz 1 pattern of PR prolongation is occurring is to compare the [[PR interval]] of the last conducted beat prior to the dropped beat with the [[PR interval]] of the first conducted beat after the dropped beat. In other words, compare the "longest" conducted [[PR interval]] to the "shortest" conducted [[PR interval]].

- vagally mediated → ↑ in vagal tone leads to PR prolongation
- The site of block in Mobitz Type 1 is usually (but not always) localized to the AV node.
- [[PR interval]] gradually prolongs, then dropped QRS
- Treatment
	- Typically none unless symptomatic
	- Consider withdrawing AV nodal blockers (although typically not done)

## Mobitz Type 2

- ==The site of Mobitz Type 2 block **always** indicates distal/infranodal block.==
- dropped QRS, but without the gradual prolonging of the [[PR interval]]
- can progress to [[Complete Heart Block (CHB)]]
- Cause: Conduction disease
- Treatment
	- Pacemaker
	- Consider temporary pacemaker until permanent pacemaker is implanted

# Third degree (3˚) AV Block


> [!hint] Rule of Thumb: Atrial and Ventricular Rates
> When the atrial rate is *faster* than the ventricular rate (and no atrial rates are conducted), [[Complete Heart Block (CHB)|CHB]] is present. If the ventricular rate is faster than the atrial rate, [[AV dissociation]] *without* [[Complete Heart Block (CHB)|CHB]] should be suspected.


- aka [[Complete Heart Block (CHB)]]
- Involves a complete block of the conduction of atrial stimuli to the ventricles → so atrial depolarizations are _not_ conducted to the ventricles. Therefore, an automaticity focus below the complete block <u>escapes</u> to pace the ventricles at its inherent rate.
- Perfusing rhythm (if present) is maintained by junctional/ventricular escape rhythm.
- Distal/infranodal 3˚ AVB is much more likely to produce Sx than 3˚ AVB located in the AV node.[^fogoros]
- ECG: 
	- [[AV dissociation]] w/ independent atrial and ventricular rates
	- **A** going at one rate and **V** going at another rate (both at stable rates, i.e. regular P-P interval and regular R-R interval)
	- If CHB localized to the AV node:
		- usually accompanied by relatively reliable escape pacemaker, localized just distally to the AV node ("high junctional" escape rhythm). Often yields a baseline HR of 40-55 bpm and responds (at least moderately well) to ↑ sympathetic tone.[^fogoros]
		- You often see this pattern where the CHB is usually localized to the AV node with **congenital** CHB too.
	- If CHB localized distal to the AV node (infranodal):
		- wide-complex, slow (20-40 bpm) escape pacemaker is a strong indicator of distal/infranodal AVB
			- by contrast, a narrow-complex and more rapid (40-55 bpm) escape rhythm suggests AV nodal block
- Evaluation:
	- BP - check for hypOtension, HD instability
	- QRS
		- if wide, suggests _escape_ rhythm (bad!)
			- May need to get the dopamine going and begin coordinating for pacing
		- if narrow, good (relatively)
	- Syncope - bad if present
- Treatment
	- Pacemaker
	- Consider temporary pacemaker until permanent pacemaker is implanted
