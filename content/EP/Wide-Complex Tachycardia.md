		- LV Origin: typically RBBB-like morphology
		- RV Origin: typically LBBB-like morphology
	- pre-excited [[Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)]]
		- SVT with conduction down an accessory pathway (antridromic AVRT)
		- pre-excited [[Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)]], i.e. WPW syndrome
	- [[Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)]] with aberrancy (abnormal intraventricular conduction)
		- Dx can confidently be made if a baseline BBB is present and the tachycardia has the _same_ morphology as this baseline block
	- ventricular paced rhythm
	- drug- and electrolyte-induced QRS widening

- Steps to evaluate and manage
	- Assess vitals
	- Assess clinical hx: CAD, COPD, etc.
	- If HD stable → 12 lead EKG, vagal maneuvers/adenosine *w/ the paper running*!
	- If HD unstable → ACLS protocol; Tx reversible causes
		- urgent cardioversion should be done with procedural sedation when feasible
			- fentanyl 50 or 2 of midazolam (usually work well)
	- If WCT terminates w/ adenosine → Tx as SVT
	- If WCT persists w/ adenosine and DDx still unclear → operate as if VT
	- Amio generally most effective Tx for recurrent/refractory WCT, particularly VT
	- If WCT d/t function over pacemaker → apply magnet over ppm → makes the pacemaker asynchronous and terminates ppm-related tachy


> [!NOTE] [[AV Dissociation]] Clues
> P waves buried in QRS complexes may cause some QRS complexes to appear "notched." Also, be on the look out for variable T wave morphology. This can be a hint to the presence of P waves that are dissociated from QRS/T and falling variably over some T waves.
