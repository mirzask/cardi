- On ECG, some P waves are followed by QRS complexes, and others are not.
- ==Symptoms are largely dependent on the **ventricular rate**.==
- The Mobitz classification helps to localize the site of the 2˚ AVB.[^fogoros]
- Autonomic maneuvers can be used to distinguish between AV nodal vs. distal/infranodal block if Type 1 or 2:1 AVB:
	- If AV nodal block, exercise/atropine will improve/resolve the block
	- If distal block, exercise/atropine will *not* improve the block and may actually worsen the block, e.g. 2:1 → 3:1 (or higher)

> [!warning] Cannot use Mobitz classification in 2:1 AV block
> You cannot use the Mobitz classification with 2:1 AV block (by definition). Many clinicians make the mistake of automatically classifying 2:1 block as Mobitz Type 2, i.e. misdiagnose 2:1 AVB as distal block. **When 2:1 block present, use another classification besides Mobitz to deduce the site of the block**.[^fogoros]


## Mobitz Type 1 (aka Wenckebach)

> [!tip] Detecting Mobitz Type 1 on ECG
> The best way to tell that the Mobitz 1 pattern of PR prolongation is occurring is to compare the [[PR interval]] of the last conducted beat prior to the dropped beat with the [[PR interval]] of the first conducted beat after the dropped beat. In other words, compare the "longest" conducted [[PR interval]] to the "shortest" conducted [[PR interval]].

- vagally mediated → ↑ in vagal tone leads to PR prolongation
- The site of block in Mobitz Type 1 is usually (but not always) localized to the AV node.
- [[PR interval]] gradually prolongs, then dropped QRS
- Treatment
	- Typically none unless symptomatic
	- Consider withdrawing AV nodal blockers (although typically not done)

## Mobitz Type 2

- ==The site of Mobitz Type 2 block **always** indicates distal/infranodal block.==
- dropped QRS, but without the gradual prolonging of the [[PR interval]]
- can progress to [[Complete Heart Block (CHB)]]
- Cause: Conduction disease
- Treatment
	- Pacemaker
	- Consider temporary pacemaker until permanent pacemaker is implanted
