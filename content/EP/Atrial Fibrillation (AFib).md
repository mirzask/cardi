- 2023 Guideline recommends that patients diagnosed with AF during hospitalization for noncardiac illness (e.g., sepsis) be counseled about their increased risk of recurrent AF
# Classification of AFib

- **Old**: AF is no longer categorized according to valvular or nonvalvular AF. As Tanenbaum would say, this typically refers to "do they have [[Mitral Stenosis|MS]] or not?"
	- This distinction is only currently used to guide OAC strategy.
- 4 stages
	- Stage 1: at-risk for AF
		- Individuals with modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, such as obesity or family history of AF
	- Stage 2: Pre-AF
		- Defined as the presence of atrial pathology, including left atrial enlargement, frequent atrial ectopy, or nonsustained atrial tachycardia, but *without* diagnosed AF
		- Includes folks with conditions associated with high incidence of AF, such as atrial flutter, HF, [[Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)|CAD]], valvular heart disease, [[Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy|HCM]], neuromuscular diseases, and hyperthyroidism
	- Stage 3: AF
		- 3a, paroxysmal AF (recurrent AF episodes lasting ‚â§ 7 days)
		- 3b, persistent AF (continuous AF episode lasting >7 days)
		- 3c, long-standing persistent AF (continuous AF episode lasting >1 year)
		- üÜï 3d, AF treated successfully with catheter ablation
	- Stage 4: permanent AF
		- decision has been made not to pursue rhythm control based on patient and clinical factors, such as age and AF duration

# Diagnosis

## New-onset AFib

- TTE to assess cardiac structure and to identify possible causes for AF (eg, valve disease), LVEF
- Labs: CBC, BMP, Mg, TSH
- If risk factors present, such as angina, ‚Üì exercise tolerance, ‚Üì LVEF, consider ischemic evaluation
- Outpatient evaluation and management is appropriate for patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic AF in the absence of HF, ischemia, or poorly controlled ventricular rates.

## Stroke and cognitive disease prevention

- In patients with estimated risk of ischemic stroke or thromboembolic events 2% or greater per year (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc 2 for men, 3 for women), benefits of OACs exceed risks of major bleeding.
- OAC therapy is associated with reduced rates of cognitive impairment and dementia.
- Anticoagulation selection
	- [[Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)|DOACs]] preferred over [[Warfarin|warfarin]] in pts w/o mechanical heart valves or moderate to severe [[Mitral Stenosis|mitral stenosis]]
		- [[Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)|DOACs]] reduce risk of intracranial hemorrhage by approximately half compared with warfarin‚ùó
		- ‚ö†Ô∏è the American Geriatrics Society recommends that because of higher bleeding rates compared with other [[Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC)|DOACs]], rivaroxaban should be avoided in adults 65 years and older with AF, except when once-daily dosing may improve medication adherence
		- ESRD/HD: Apixaban and rivaroxaban are approved for patients receiving dialysis based on limited pharmacokinetic data.
- [[Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO)]]
	- üìù No direct evidence from randomized clinical trials exists on benefits of pLAAO in OAC-ineligible patients. LAAO was US FDA approved based on randomized clinical trials comparing LAAO with [[Warfarin|warfarin]] in warfarin-eligible patients
	- requires at least 45 days of OACs followed by dual antiplatelet therapy for 6 months and lifelong aspirin (325 mg)
		- ‚ö†Ô∏è some situations, such as peri-device leak greater than 5 mm or device thrombosis, require prolonged OACs after LAAO
- Post-PCI
	- Aspirin should be discontinued early (1-4 weeks) after PCI with continuation of OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor ([[Clopidogrel|clopidogrel]] preferred over ticagrelor or prasugrel) over triple antithrombotic therapy (OAC, aspirin, and P2Y12 inhibitor) to reduce clinically relevant bleeding risk.
- [[Stable Ischemic Heart Disease (SIHD)]]/Chronic coronary disease
	- Current guidelines recommend OAC monotherapy over OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF and chronic coronary artery disease who have undergone coronary revascularization more than 1 year previously, unless the patient has a history of prior stent thrombosis
	- Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events With Rivaroxaban in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease (AFIRE) trial
		- rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to rivaroxaban plus aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitors for preventing major bleeding (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.390.89]; P = .01) and noninferior for major cardiovascular events (4.14% and 5.75% per patient-year; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.55-0.95]; P < .001).
- Post-ablation
	- After ablation, OACs should be continued for *at least* **3 months**; subsequent decisions should be guided by patients stroke risk

## Rate Control

- [[Beta-blockers]], such as metoprolol, esmolol, or atenolol, and nondihydropyridine [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]], such as verapamil or diltiazem, to slow electrical conduction through the atrioventricular node.
- [[Digoxin]] can be used as adjunctive therapy when ventricular rate remains poorly controlled or hypotension limits further titration of [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] and/or [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]] 
- Titrate üíä to control symptoms and achieve resting heart rates less than 100 to 110 beats per minute
## Rhythm Control

- "Pill-in-the-pocket" strategy
	- flecainide or propafenone in conjunction with concomitant AVNB agents (e.g., [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] or [[Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)|CCBs]]) 
	- may be useful for intermittent treatment of infrequent AF episodes, but efficacy for acute conversion and safety (pro-arrhythmic effect) must first be tested in a monitored hospital setting.
		- Patients should be observed for at least 8 hours after dose.
- EAST-AFNET 4 reported clinical benefit of rhythm control with daily AAD or catheter ablation over rate control therapy when rhythm control was initiated <u>early</u> (ie, within 12 months of AF diagnosis)
	- Most patients (87%) were initially treated with AADs, including flecainide (35.9%), amiodarone (19.6%), and dronedarone (16.7%), whereas 19.4% underwent ablation by 2 years.
	- stopped early due to a 21% reduction in the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and hospitalizations for HF or acute coronary syndrome with rhythm control vs rate control (3.9 per 100 person-years vs 5.0 per 100 person-years)

## Ablation

# Screening

## LOOP Study

- LOOP Study (Implantable Loop Recorder Detection of Atrial Fibrillation to Prevent Stroke) randomized 6004 patients aged 70 to 90 years with 1 or more of 4 comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, prior stroke, or HF) to ILR or usual care
- More AFib Dx
	- AF was diagnosed in 31.8% of the ILR group vs 12.2% of the control group. 
- No difference in outcomes
	- Although more OACs were initiated in patients diagnosed with incident AF, there was no significant difference (HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.61-1.05]) in risk of the primary outcome of stroke or systemic arterial embolism in patients randomized to ILR (0.88 events per 100 person-years [95% CI, 0.68-1.12] vs the control group, 1.09 events [95% CI, 0.96-1.24]).
