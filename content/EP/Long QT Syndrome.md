- Loss of function mutations in IKs and IKr prolong QT interval and produce [[Long QT Syndrome#LQTS Type 1|LQTS1]] and [[Long QT Syndrome#LQTS Type 2|LQT2]], respectively.
- The appearance of T wave can be a clue to type of LQTS
	- symmetric, tortoise hump shaped is seen with [[Long QT Syndrome#LQTS Type 1|Type 1]]
	- late-peaking/double hump appearance is seen with [[Long QT Syndrome#LQTS Type 2|Type 2]]

# LQTS Type 1


# LQTS Type 2

- Caused by blockage of IKr channel
- Most common cause of drug-induced prolonged QT syndrome as many drugs are IKr blockers
- Second most common of LQT subtypes (25-30%)
- Exacerbated by auditory stimuli üîä
	- Events caused by alarm clocks, startle response, exercise
- Responsive to treatment with [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] and exercise restriction
- [[Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)|ICD]] indicated for:
	- female patients with LQT2
	- QTc > 500ms
	- history of syncope/SCA
- üìù Treating a patient with [[Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs|K-channel blockers]] like **sotalol** or **dofetilide** is *like* giving someone LQTS type 2, i.e. like block IKr channels.
# LQTS Type 3

- Caused by gain of function of INa (SCN5a)
- Third most common of LQT subtypes (5-10%), considered most lethal
- Exacerbated by bradycardia, sleep
- Events only occur during sleep, so no warning signs, often present with SCA
- Responsive to treatment with [[Beta-blockers|BBs]] and exercise restriction, less so than LQT1, new data suggest role for [[Ranolazine|ranolazine]], [[Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs|mexiletine]]
- Diagnostic testing with suspected ECG and genetic testing
- ICD indicated for *all* patients with LQT3
