- Relatively common and *generally* carries little prognostic significance.[^fogoros]
	- Most younger patients with RBBB have no underlying heart disease
	- In fact, prognosis has little to do with the RBBB itself and more to do with the underlying process that causes the RBBB
- With a functional Left bundle, i.e. isolated RBBB, then these patients do not appear to uffer from clinically significant ventricular dyssynchrony → LV contractions remain coordinated and efficient.
- Incidence ↑ with age [^fogoros]
	- <1% in 50 yo → 10% in 80 yo
- Common in conditions that affect the right ventricle, e.g. [[Pulmonary Hypertension]], right [[Ventricular Hypertrophy|ventricular hypertrophy]], RV inflammation or infarction. Can also appear abruptly with sudden ↑ in R-sided filling pressures, e.g. [[Pulmonary Embolism]].
- Widened, R-R' appearance detected in leads V1 and V2
