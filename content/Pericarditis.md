# Acute pericarditis
- Work-up: CBC, ESR, CRP (abnormal if > 3 mg/L), CK, troponin, 12-lead ECG, CXR
	- Consider TB testing in the appropriate context
- Echo
	- If acute pericarditis and LV dysfunction, most (85%) will have recovery after 12 months
- Empiric therapy
	- Aspirin 750-1,000 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 250-500 mg every 1-2 weeks
	- Ibuprofen 600 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 200-400 mg every 1-2 weeks.
	- 3 month course of Colchicine 0.5 mg BID (if weight > 70 kg) or 0.5 mg daily (if weight < 70 kg) (based on 2013 ICAP study)
	- PPI for gastroprotection (if prescribed ASA or NSAIDs)
- Activity limitations
	- If not involved in athletic sports, recommend restrict physical activity beyond ordinary sedentary life until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP
	- If athlete, recommended to return to competitive sports only after symptoms have resolved and diagnostic tests (i.e. CRP, ECG and echocardiogram) have normalized
	- Duration: Expert consensus recommends activity restriction for a minimum of 3 months for athletes, whereas a shorter period (until remission) may be suitable for non-athletes.
- Dispo: close follow-up in 1 week to assess therapeutic response

- Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory pericardial syndrome with or without pericardial effusion.
- With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course.[^jama]
- In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (<0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (<3%) can be life-threatening.[^jama]
- Causes
	- In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. 
	- Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis.
- Among patients with a malignant pericardial effusion, the most common causes are lung (‚âà40%), breast (‚âà25%), and hematologic (‚âà20%) malignancies.[^jama]
- Poor prognostic markers ‚Äì if present, may warrant hospital admission
	- Fever
	- Subacute course, i.e. Sx over several days w/o a clear-cut onset
	- Large [[Pericardial Effusion|pericardial effusion]], i.e. diastolic echo-free space >2 cm
	- [[Pericardial Tamponade|Cardiac tamponade]]
	- Failure to respond w/in 7 days to NSAIDs

## Diagnosis of Acute Pericarditis

- Clinical diagnosis can be made with ‚â•2 of the following criteria:
	- [[Chest Pain|chest pain]] (>85‚Äì90% of cases)‚Äîtypically sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward; worsens when supine
	- pericardial friction rub (‚â§33% of cases)‚Äîa superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope ü©∫ over the left sternal border
	- ECG changes (up to 60% of cases)‚Äîwith new widespread ST elevation or PR depression in the acute phase
		- NOTE: ECG changes imply inflammation of the epicardium, since the parietal pericardium itself is electrically inert
	- [[Pericardial Effusion|pericardial effusion]] (up to 60% of cases, generally mild)
- CRP, ESR, WBC elevation is common and may be helpful to monitor disease activity and therapeutic efficacy
- Increased markers of myocardial injury (e.g. CK, troponin) may suggest concomitant [[Myocarditis|myocarditis]]

| [[Colchicine]] | 0.5 mg daily (< 70 kg) or 0.5 mg BID (‚â• 70 kg) | 3 months    | Not mandatory, alternatively 0.5 mg every other day (< 70 kg) or 0.5 mg once (270 kg) in the last weeks |
- Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and CRP level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of [[Colchicine|colchicine]] to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%).[^jama]
- Empiric therapy
	- [[Aspirin]] 750-1,000 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 250-500 mg every 1-2 weeks
	- Ibuprofen 600 mg q8h for 1-2 weeks. If response, plan to taper by decreasing dose by 200-400 mg every 1-2 weeks.
	- [[Colchicine]] 0.6 mg BID (if weight \> 70 kg) or 0.5 mg daily (if weight \< 70 kg). Often prescribed as adjunct to [[Aspirin]]/NSAID. Tapering is not mandatory.
		- Contraindicated if severe renal impairment, pregnant/lactating women
	- üìù [[Steroids]] only used if contraindications and failure to ASA/NSAIDs. If used, low to moderate doses (i.e. prednisone 0.2-0.5 mg/kg/day or equivalent) should be recommended instead of high doses (i.e. prednisone 1.0 mg/kg/day or equivalent). initial dose should be maintained until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP, then tapering should be considered.
		- ‚ö†Ô∏è In observational studies, corticosteroids, especially at higher doses (eg, prednisone [1.0 mg/kg daily]), have been associated with an increased risk of recurrence of pericarditis. ‚à¥, corticosteroids should only be prescribed at low to moderate doses (prednisone [0.25-0.5 mg/kg daily]) in patients who do not improve with NSAIDS and colchicine or have adverse outcomes with or contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine. [^jama]
- PPI for gastroprotection (if prescribed ASA or NSAIDs)
- **Activity limitations**
	- If *not* involved in athletic sports, recommend restrict physical activity beyond ordinary sedentary life until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP
	- If <u>athlete</u> üèÉ, recommended to return to competitive sports only after symptoms have resolved and diagnostic tests (i.e. CRP, ECG and echocardiogram) have normalized
	- **Duration**: Expert consensus recommends activity restriction for a minimum of 3 months for athletes, whereas a shorter period (until remission) may be suitable for non-athletes.
- **Dispo**: close follow-up in 1 week to assess therapeutic response
# Incessant Pericarditis

- Incessant pericarditis is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 to 6 weeks but less than 3 months without remission.[^jama]
- 20% of patients with incessant pericarditis develop [[Constrictive Pericarditis|constrictive pericarditis]] [^jama]
# Recurrent Pericarditis

- Try to target underlying etiology (if identifiable cause present)
- Aspirin or NSAIDs remain the mainstay of therapy + Colchicine as adjunct
- If incomplete response to ASA/NSAID + colchicine combo, then can *consider* **steroids** as an add-on to low-/moderate-dose ASA/NSAID + colchicine, i.e. 'triple therapy'
	- See ESC 2015 guidelines for recommendations on tapering steroid therapy

![[Pericarditis-20240924215822903.webp|612]]

- Drugs such as IVIG, anakinra and azathioprine may be considered in cases of proven infection-negative, corticosteroid-dependent, recurrent pericarditis not responsive to colchicine after careful assessment of the costs, risks and eventually consultation by multidisciplinary experts, including immunologists and/or rheumatologists, in the absence of a specific expertise. It is also mandatory to educate the patient and his/her caregivers about the clinical risks related to immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive drugs and the safety measures to adopt during the treatment.
- As a last resort, **pericardiectomy** may be considered, but only after a thorough trial of unsuccessful medical therapy, and with referral of the patient to a centre with specific expertise in this surgery.
