The aortic root is a geometrically complex structure that includes:
1. the aortic valve annulus,
	1. not a true or distinct anatomic structure but is a virtual ring that may be defined by joining the basal attachments, or nadirs, of the three aortic leaflets. The distal (uppermost) attachments of the leaflets, in the shape of a crown, form a true anatomic ring.

2. the interleaflet triangles,
3. the semilunar aortic leaflets and their attachments,
4. the aortic sinuses of Valsalva, and
5. the sinotubular junction.


- Aortic measurements should be made at the following sites: 
	1. the [[Aortic Valve|aortic valve]] annulus,
	2. the maximal diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva,
	3. the sinotubular junction (usually a demarcated transition between the sinuses of Valsalva and the tubular portion of the ascending aorta), and 
	4. the maximal diameter of the proximal ascending aorta, including a notation of the distance between the measurement site and the sinotubular junction.

- When in the cardiac cycle should you make these aortic root measurements?
	- <u>mid-systole</u> for [[Aortic Valve|aortic valve]] annulus
		- measurements of the aortic annulus should be made in the zoom mode using standard electronic calipers in midsystole, when the annulus is slightly larger and rounder than in diastole, between the hinge points of the aortic valve leaflets (usually between the hinge point of the right coronary cusp and the edge of the sinus at the side of the commissures between the left coronary cusp and the noncoronary cusp) from **inner edge to inner edge**. 
	- <u>end-diastole</u> for all other aortic root measurements
		- All other aortic measurements should be made at end-diastole, in a strictly perpendicular plane to that of the long axis of the aorta.
