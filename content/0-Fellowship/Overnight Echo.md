So you got called into to do an overnight Echo? You’re (probably) tired and don’t remember all the little hoops you need to jump through. Just follow the steps below:

- In Epic, click the Epic button at the top left of the screen → select ‘Change Context’
- You will select the `SLH CV ULTRASOUND` context
- If it’s your first time, you may be asked to select some status boards. The main ones you want are `SLH CV US Schedule` and `SLH CV US Trackboard Tech Worklist`
- Once you’ve got this setup, at the top half of the screen, you’ll see `SLH CV US Schedule`. The right side may have no patient list pulled up. You will click somewhere on this right side area. There will be a row of buttons at the top → towards the left you’ll see ⚙️ `Views`. Under ⚙️ `Views`, select the option `SLH CV US Orders Report`.
- You want to move the order of interest from the right half of the screen to the left half.
    - Highlight the order for the Echo you need to do
    - Click ‘Add-on’ to schedule the patient either by right clicking and selecting or by selecting the ‘Add-on’ button at the top row.
    - You’ll select `SLH CV US Portable` and the click the ‘Schedule’ button
- Click ‘Check-in’ (if not already done when you clicked ‘Schedule’)
- Click ‘Begin Exam’
- Complete the questions in the ‘Navigator’ and then select ‘Mark as begun’
- Go scan the patient
    - Click ‘Update Worklist’ to find the patient’s name
- When you’re done, click ‘End Exam’ on the Ultrasound machine. Give it time to upload the images to the server.
- There may be more to it, but I’m too tired to remember right now.
