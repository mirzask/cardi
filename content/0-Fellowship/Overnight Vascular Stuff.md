# Pull [[Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP)]]

- In the very rare situation that attending requests IABP to be pulled after 5 pm for some reason (e.g., ACT didnâ€™t come down < 150 during the day, etc.),
	- you may pull if youâ€™ve done <u>2 supervised pulls</u> already and you feel comfortable doing it on your own
	- if not, call UH fellow on call if they are comfortable and certified
	- if UH fellow is a no-go, then call interventional attending on call

# EP Procedural Complications

- If weekday *before* 10 pm, call EP fellow (first preference is to call the fellow more involved in the patient's care)
- If weekday *after* 10 pm or weekend, call any EP attending on call at any of the SLH hospitals. 
- If no EP attending on call, call the EP attending who did the procedure.
- If theyâ€™re not available, call general cardiology attending on call.

# Cath Complications

- **Minor bleeding** (hemodynamically stable, hemostasis with manual compression (general rule of thumb is to apply pressure for 3-5 minutes per French), hematoma < 10 cm) â†’Â 
	- clinical monitoring
	- obtain imaging (arterial doppler, CT non-contrast can rapidly diagnose [[Retroperitoneal Hematoma|retroperitoneal hematoma]] though doesnâ€™t show site of extravasation)
- **Major bleeding** (hemodynamically unstable, no hemostasis despite appropriate manual compression; expanding hematoma or retroperitoneal hematoma) â†’ 
	- ðŸ“ž **Call interventional attending on call (interventional fellow not part of algorithm)**;Â  
	- IVF/transfuse
	- Move to ICU
	- Angiogram or vascular intervention per interventional attending
