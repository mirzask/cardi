- The coronary arterial system consists of **epicardial coronary arteries**, **prearterioles**, and **arterioles** with different sizes, distinct functions, and uninterrupted borders. [^asia]
	- Myocardial ischemia from the mismatch of demand and supply of coronary artery blood flow to the myocardium can originate from any part of this coronary arterial system

# Primary Prevention

- Healthful lifestyle & diet
	- [[Mediterranean Diet]]
- <u>No</u> Routine [[Aspirin]] in Primary Prevention if >70 y or if bleeding risk
- Goal LDL: (See [[Hyperlipidemia#Approach to Hyperlipidemia|Approach to Hyperlipidemia]])
	- Known [[ASCVD Risk Calculator|ASCVD]] <55
	- Primary Prevention < 100
- Three Q's/Four Groups (See mermaid diagram in [[Hyperlipidemia#Approach to Hyperlipidemia|Approach to Hyperlipidemia]])
	- [[ASCVD Risk Calculator|ASCVD]]
	- LDL≥190 ([[Familial Hyperlipidemia]])
	- [[Diabetes]]
	- Non-[[Diabetes|DM]]

	- [[Diabetes]]
	- [[Hyperlipidemia#'Risk Enhancers'|Risk-enhancers]]
	- [[Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)]]
- Consider [[Lipoprotein (a)|Lp(a)]] if Fam Hx early ASCVD
- Consider ApoB if TG ≥ 200
