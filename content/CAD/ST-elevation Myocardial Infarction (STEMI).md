# Coding and Documentation

- Coding and Documentation
	- Acute STEMI
		- Presents within 12 hours or less of initial symptoms
	- Late Presentation STEMI
		- between 12 and 24 hours after symptom onset
		- Diagnosis in note should be "Late presentation STEMI"
	- ![](https://cardiovascularbusiness.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/emory%202.png)
	- If diagnosis has changed - change it in the note!
		- STEMI → Late Presentation STEMI
		- STEMI *and* Cardiac Arrest → just Cardiac Arrest
		- STEMI → NSTEMI
		- NSTEMI Type I vs Type II
	- Document reason for not following GMT
		- "BB held for hypotension and will be reevaluated at follow up appointment"
		- "ACE/ARB held d/t...."
		- "Cardiac rehab not appropriate b/c..."
- Reciprocal ∆ makes STE more specific for **ischemia** as the underlying etiology
- Q waves (with normal ST segments) = "old" MI
- Anterolateral STEMI
	- Cause: Occlusion of the LAD
- Acute Inferior Posterior STEMI
	- Tip: quick way is to turn your ECG upside → see the STE and Q waves in V1-V2
	- Cause: Occlusion of the RCA (LCx) artery
