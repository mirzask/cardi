- On initial evaluation, you will want to determine the likelihood symptoms represent ACS?
	- High, Intermediate, Low
		- As described in the [[Chest Pain]] guidelines, we can describe these patients CP as being "Cardiac", "Possibly Cardiac", "Non-Cardiac"
		- Search alternative etiologies in low-likelihood patients
	- Tools:
		- History, Exam, ECG, Biomarkers (serial)
		- Scores: AHCPR, AHA/ACC Risk, HEART Score, etc

# Non-STE ACS

```
- TIMI ***, GRACE ***
- DAPT: ASA, ***
- AC: heparin gtt (per ACS protocol)
- Metoprolol tartrate ***
- SLN PRN
	- If refractory, consider nitroglycerin gtt
- *** Supplemental oxygen if O2 < 90
- Telemetry
- NPO at midnight for possible cath
