- Right heart failure can be broken down into ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù:
	- Volume overload
		- causes include valvular disease ([[Tricuspid Regurgitation|TR]], pulmonic insufficiency) and left-to-right shunts ([[Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)|ASD]], [[Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)|VSD]], [[Sinus Venosus Defect|sinus venosus defect]], coronary sinus defect, [[Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)|PAPVR]])
	- Pressure overload (or excessive [[Afterload|afterload]])
		- causes include pulmonary arterial hypertension, [[Pulmonary Embolism|pulmonary embolism]] and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis, chronic hypoxemia, and longstanding elevated LAP causing group 2 [[Pulmonary Hypertension|PH]] ([[Mitral Regurgitation|MR]]/[[Mitral Stenosis|MS]], [[Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)|HFrEF]], [[Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)|HFpEF]])
	- primary cardiomyopathic processes (i.e., ischemia, infiltration, ARVC)
		- causes include [[Amyloidosis|cardiac amyloidosis]], right ventricular myocardial infarction, post-transplant right ventricular dysfunction, and [[Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)|ARVC]]
- üí° In cases of severe right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction without apparent cause, look for a left to right shunt lesion (i.e., [[Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)|VSD]], [[Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)|ASD]], [[Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)|PAPVR]]). Sometimes further imaging (TEE, cardiac CT, cardiac MRI) is necessary to detect these lesions if not visualized on TTE.

o	A left-to-right shunt is when oxygenated blood from the systemic circulation (left) inappropriately mixes with the pulmonary circulation (right), increasing the oxygen concentration. This can occur via anomalous pulmonary veins, defects at the atrial or ventricular level, or sometimes systemic arterio-venous fistulas.
o	As the SGC is  passed through the great vessels and cardiac chambers, samples are collected at various levels.
o	A left to right shunt is detected by an oximetry ‚Äústep up‚Äù where oxygenated blood from the systemic circulation blood mixes with deoxygenated blood from the venous circulation.
ÔÇß	An oxygen saturation step up of >7% is considered significant at the level of the great veins and RA while a step up of >5% is considered significant at levels distal to the RA.
o	Qp/Qs
ÔÇß	Calculated to examine the degree of left to right shunting
ÔÇß	Small shunts are defined by Qp/Qs <1.5. 
‚Ä¢	These are often asymptomatic and generally do not need to be treated. 
ÔÇß	Large shunts are defined by Qp/Qs >2 and often require closure.
ÔÇß	Interpretation: for a  Qp/Qs is 3.1, it means that for every 1 L of cardiac output through the systemic circulation, 3.1 L are going through the pulmonary circulation
o	Because intra-cardiac shunts will affect the mixed venous (pulmonary artery oxygen saturation), a systemic mixed venous saturation needs to be calculated to estimate ‚Äúpre-shunt‚Äù mixed venous O2. This is defined by Flamm‚Äôs formula: (3*SVC +IVC)/4
