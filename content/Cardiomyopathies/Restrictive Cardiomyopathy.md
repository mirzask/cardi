- Normal (e.g. LVEF, wall thickness, etc.), but with restrictive filling patterns
- üìù Many disorders manifest restrictive ‚Äúphysiology‚Äù and must be excluded (eg, [[Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy]] and [[Constrictive Pericarditis]])

	- Atrial enlargement
		- reflects ventricular noncompliance and may also result from primary atrial myocardial involvement by the disease process (eg, amyloidosis)
	- [[Echo Doppler|Doppler]]
		- Rapid E wave with short deceleration time (indicating ‚Üë early LV filling velocity) and very little atrial contribution to ventricular filling (i.e. relatively small A-wave)
			- ![[Untitled-20250120211708160.webp|422]]
		- ‚Üì isovolumic relaxation time
		- Pulmonary vein doppler: almost no systolic forward flow and mostly all forward flow is seen in early diastole
		- [[Tissue Doppler]] velocity shows a very low e' velocity
	- Cath Hemodynamics
		- ‚Üë Filling Pressures
		- Dip and plateau morphology (aka "square-root sign")
			- nonspecific indicator of stiff noncompliant chambers
		- LVEDP >5 mm Hg + RVEDP
		- RVEDP <1/3 of RVSP
		- RVSP >50 mmHg
		- Ventricular concordance

# Management

- Idiopathic RCM
	- Cautious Diuresis
		- Many patients are dependent on preload, ‚à¥ can't lower it too much otherwise patients will have a ‚Üì in BP and feel like üí©
	- [[Beta-blockers]], but not as aggressive as [[Dilated Cardiomyopathy|DCM]]
		- Filling in RCM is restricted to *early* diastole, ‚à¥ if you ‚Üì HR down *too much* ‚Üí restrict overall cardiac output
	- Cardiac Transplantation (esp if advanced)
