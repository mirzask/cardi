- CAD-RADS categories are based on stenosis severity and plaque burden.

<center>Grading scale for stenosis severity</center>

| **Degree of luminal diameter stenosis** | **Terminology**     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0%                                      | No visible stenosis |
| 1–24%                                   | Minimal stenosis    |
| 25–49%                                  | Mild stenosis       |
| 50–69%                                  | Moderate stenosis   |
| 70–99%                                  | Severe stenosis     |
| 100%                                    | Occluded            |

<center>Grading scale for plaque burden severity</center>

| **Terminology** | **Overall plaque burden**  |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| P1              | Mild amount of plaque      |
| P2              | Moderate amount of plaque  |
| P3              | Severe amount of plaque    |
| P4              | Extensive amount of plaque |
