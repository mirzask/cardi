- Most common indication we see for CTA chest is for further evaluation after dilated ascending aorta noted on Echo.
- CT is gold-standard to measure aortic size within the chest

# Load Images

- You will see several `Series` available for your review, which are just different reconstructions.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219085741.png]]
- Step 1: You will begin by first looking at the **topogram**.
- Next, you‚Äôll look first at the `Series` that generally has the most images, e.g. the example above would be `Series#: 5` that has 528 images. This contains the most images because it has the _thinnest_ slice thickness. 
	- For this Series, you‚Äôll notice the second line reads `Chest W 0.6‚Ä¶` the `0.6` indicates that it is 0.6 mm, which is the thinnest slice we currently have available.
- Adam‚Äôs preferred workflow is `Right Click` ‚Üí Select `ABDOMEN` ‚Üí Select `CTA Runoff`
	- üìù You may then be asked if you need to `Clear the output panel now?`, and you will select `Yes`.

- For 4D studies, you‚Äôll `Right Click` ‚Üí Select `HEART` ‚Üí Select `Cardiac`

# 3D View

- Double click on the 3D Reconstruction image to open it up.
- Change your layering by holding the Left- and Right-click buttons down on your mouse and dragging up/down.
- To remove ribs, wires, etc. click the `FreeRO` button (as shown below). Once in `FreeRO` mode, you will hold down the `Shift` button and select the regions you‚Äôd like to remove.

- üìù When you have a nice image you‚Äôd like to stash for later review (e.g., to share/discuss with attending), Adam encourages us to Right-click and select `Capture`, which stores these cuts in the `Series List`.

# Axial View

- Adam likes to start with examining the venous system, which is where the contrast starts.
- Scrolling down to evaluate the venous system
	- Any [[Persistent Left-sided Superior Vena Cava|persistent left-sided SVC]]?
	- Ensure L and R brachiocephalic vv. drains into the SVC as usual
	- As you scroll down further, you‚Äôll see the azygous vein coming off the SVC posteriorly. 
	- The SVC will drop into the Right atrium
	- Scrolling down from the RA will reveal the IVC
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219090713.webp|280]]
- Evaluate the **pulmonary veins**
	- Look out to see if there is **[[Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)|partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR)]]**. 
	- If you can count 4 major pulmonary veins sticking out, you can be pretty confident there is no [[Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)|PAPVR]]. 
		- RV enlargement may prompt you to look more closely.
- Evaluate the **[[Left Atrial Appendage|left atrial appendage]]**
	- You want to look to make sure it fills completely with contrast. 
	- If it doesn‚Äôt fill completely, it could be suggestive of a thrombus! However, sometimes it won‚Äôt fill completely because it takes a while for contrast to fill. In those cases, we‚Äôll run a delayed series. This involves scanning the LAA 30 seconds later to see if the contrast doesn‚Äôt actually fill. If these delayed series are present in our system, you‚Äôll see them available in the `Series List` and they‚Äôll be marked Delay.
		- While we use 30 seconds, other institutions use different times to reassess for delayed contrast filling to r/o thrombus.
		- Nice meta-analysis demonstrating the excellent diagnostic accuracy of CT with delayed imaging for detection of LA/LAA thrombus [here](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circimaging.112.000153).
	- üìù Recall, TEE is considered the gold standard for detect LA/LAA thrombus.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219091612.webp]]
		- Arrow highlights LAA thrombus
- Evaluate the **Pulmonary artery**
	- Push down the `D` button and drag your cursor to measure the diameter. You will generally want <32 mm in size for a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù measurement.
- Look for MAC or AV calcification
- Look at the coronary artery anatomy
	- Dedicated studies to evaluate coronary artery anatomy often will involve the use of BB, nitroglycerin and optimal contrast timing to appropriately assess the coronary arteries. This is not the case for CTA chest, so you‚Äôll have to take things with a grain of salt.
- Make sure there are normal origins, make note of [[Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)|CAC]] (if any).
