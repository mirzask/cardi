- Most common indication we see for CTA chest is for further evaluation after dilated ascending aorta noted on Echo.
- CT is gold-standard to measure aortic size within the chest

# Load Images

- You will see several `Series` available for your review, which are just different reconstructions.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219085741.png]]
- Step 1: You will begin by first looking at the **topogram**.
- Next, you‚Äôll look first at the `Series` that generally has the most images, e.g. the example above would be `Series#: 5` that has 528 images. This contains the most images because it has the _thinnest_ slice thickness. 
	- For this Series, you‚Äôll notice the second line reads `Chest W 0.6‚Ä¶` the `0.6` indicates that it is 0.6 mm, which is the thinnest slice we currently have available.
- Adam‚Äôs preferred workflow is `Right Click` ‚Üí Select `ABDOMEN` ‚Üí Select `CTA Runoff`
	- üìù You may then be asked if you need to `Clear the output panel now?`, and you will select `Yes`.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219090443.webp]]
- For 4D studies, you‚Äôll `Right Click` ‚Üí Select `HEART` ‚Üí Select `Cardiac`

# 3D View

- Double click on the 3D Reconstruction image to open it up.
- Change your layering by holding the Left- and Right-click buttons down on your mouse and dragging up/down.
- To remove ribs, wires, etc. click the `FreeRO` button (as shown below). Once in `FreeRO` mode, you will hold down the `Shift` button and select the regions you‚Äôd like to remove.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219090602.webp]]
- üìù When you have a nice image you‚Äôd like to stash for later review (e.g., to share/discuss with attending), Adam encourages us to Right-click and select `Capture`, which stores these cuts in the `Series List`.

# Axial View

- Adam likes to start with examining the venous system, which is where the contrast starts.
- Scrolling down to evaluate the venous system
	- Any [[Persistent Left-sided Superior Vena Cava|persistent left-sided SVC]]?
	- Ensure L and R brachiocephalic vv. drains into the SVC as usual
	- As you scroll down further, you‚Äôll see the azygous vein coming off the SVC posteriorly. 
	- The SVC will drop into the Right atrium
	- Scrolling down from the RA will reveal the IVC
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219090713.webp|280]]
- Evaluate the **pulmonary veins**
	- Look out to see if there is **[[Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)|partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR)]]**. 
	- If you can count 4 major pulmonary veins sticking out, you can be pretty confident there is no [[Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (PAPVR)|PAPVR]]. 
		- RV enlargement may prompt you to look more closely.
- Evaluate the **[[Left Atrial Appendage|left atrial appendage]]**
	- You want to look to make sure it fills completely with contrast. 
	- If it doesn‚Äôt fill completely, it could be suggestive of a thrombus! However, sometimes it won‚Äôt fill completely because it takes a while for contrast to fill. In those cases, we‚Äôll run a delayed series. This involves scanning the LAA 30 seconds later to see if the contrast doesn‚Äôt actually fill. If these delayed series are present in our system, you‚Äôll see them available in the `Series List` and they‚Äôll be marked Delay.
		- While we use 30 seconds, other institutions use different times to reassess for delayed contrast filling to r/o thrombus.
		- Nice meta-analysis demonstrating the excellent diagnostic accuracy of CT with delayed imaging for detection of LA/LAA thrombus [here](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circimaging.112.000153).
	- üìù Recall, TEE is considered the gold standard for detect LA/LAA thrombus.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219091612.webp]]
		- Arrow highlights LAA thrombus
- Evaluate the **Pulmonary artery**
	- Push down the `D` button and drag your cursor to measure the diameter. You will generally want <32 mm in size for a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù measurement. I've also heard anything >28 mm 
- Look for MAC or AV calcification
- Look at the coronary artery anatomy
	- Dedicated studies to evaluate coronary artery anatomy often will involve the use of BB, nitroglycerin and optimal contrast timing to appropriately assess the coronary arteries. This is not the case for CTA chest, so you‚Äôll have to take things with a grain of salt.
- Make sure there are normal origins, make note of [[Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)|CAC]] (if any).


# Measuring Aortic Sizes

- Start at the sinuses of Valsalva
- Hit `X` to grab your cross-hairs. You will drag the cross hairs to the middle of the sinuses of Valsalva in the axial view window.
- In your coronal view window, there is a pink/red line with a small circle. Drag this circle to line up the pink/red line to be perpendicular to the wall of the sinus of Valsalva. The blue/purple line should be in the center of the long-axis of the aorta at the sinus of Valsalva.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219093520.webp|516]]
- Similarly for your sagittal view, you will want your pink/red line to be perpendicular to the sinuses of Valsalva. You will also want your green line to be in the center of the long-axis of the aorta at the sinus of Valsalva.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219093535.webp|515]]
- Once you‚Äôve lined things up, in your axial view window you will now have what is called a ‚Äútrue short axis‚Äù of the aorta at that level.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219093600.webp|494]]
- Slide up and down to evaluate the AV anatomy. You will be able to determine if it is tricuspid, bicuspid, etc.
	- Recall, the RCC is going to be the most anterior cusp. HINT: There is an ‚ÄòA‚Äô (for anterior) at the top of the axial window and a ‚ÄòP‚Äô (for posterior) at the bottom to help orient you.

## Measure at sinuses of Valsalva

- Measure aortic root diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva on CT
	- Drag the lines until you see the widest section in the coronal and sagittal planes
	- Now in your axial view (SAX), you will measure commissure to sinus. 
		- RCC measurement:
			- Normally, this will be from the commissure between the LCC and NCC
			- You will then drag up to the sinus of the RCC
		- NCC measurement:
			- LCC and RCC commissure ‚Üí sinus of NCC
		- LCC measurement:
			- RCC and NCC commissure ‚Üí sinus of LCC
		- ![[Pasted image 20241219093726.webp|409]]

## Measure at Sinotubular Junction

- Drag the lines to the sinotubular junction, i.e. where the sinuses and the tubule combine
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219093908.webp]]
- In the axial view, the ‚Äútrue short axis‚Äù should be pretty close to appearing like a circle.
	- üìù Hit `X` to get the cross-hairs off.
- Hit `Alt+D` to automagically measure
- Right click and Capture to stash the image and measurement

## Measure at the widest segment

- The widest segment (typically) is at the mid-aorta at the level of the main pulmonary artery (MPA)
- Same as above, drag your crosshairs to the desired level and adjust to be perpendicular to the artery wall in the coronal and sagittal views. Line up the blue/green line to be in the center/parallel to the long axis of the aorta at that level.
- In the axial view, the ‚Äútrue short axis‚Äù should appear like a circle
- `Alt+D` to auto-measure
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219094025.webp|521]]
- Right click and `Capture` to add this to the `Series List`

## Measure the proximal descending thoracic aorta

- Note: the proximal descending thoracic aorta begins immediately distal to the great vessels (not when the aorta physically starts descending), i.e. after the takeoff of the L subclavian artery
- Line things up in two of the views. In the example Adam showed, he lined it up in the axial and sagittal views and made the measurement in the coronal view.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219094116.webp|466]]
- Note: the shape of the proximal descending thoracic aorta will _not_ be perfectly circular.

## Measure aorta using "candy cane" view

- Rotate your cross hairs so you are cutting through both the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.
- ![[Pasted image 20241219094213.webp|343]]
- Last step is to click the `MPR` button at the top right and change it to `MIP`
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219094235.webp]]
- Hit `Ctrl`, hit the button down and drag sideways, you can increase/decrease the slab thickness. For example, this may allow you to capture the entire thickness of the aorta in different planes by manipulating the slab thickness.
- Hit `D` to make measurements at different levels of the aorta. Provides a sanity check to make sure you didn‚Äôt miss a larger/wider part of the aorta.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219094309.webp|528]]
- Right-click and select ‚ÄòCapture‚Äô to store this image with your measurements.
