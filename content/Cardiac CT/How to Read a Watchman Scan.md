# Pre-implant scan

- CT provides accurate measurements of the LAA ostial diameter, landing zone diameter, and LAA length, which are vital for accurate sizing of the device. CT allows evaluation of the relationship with the pulmonary veins and other adjacent structures that can be injured during the procedure. CT also simulates procedural fluoroscopic angles and provides evaluation of the interatrial septum, which is punctured during LAA closure.

# Post-implant
