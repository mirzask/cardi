- After looking at the **topogram**, look at the Left atrial appendage *delay* image. This `Series` will be called something like `LAA DELAY‚Ä¶`
- Scroll through to make sure that the LAA fills appropriately with contrast.
- The image `Series` that has the word ‚Äú**Multiphase**‚Äù contains the actual gated heart study, i.e. obtained through all of the phases. 
	- Open this study using a 4D workflow by Right clicking ‚Üí Select `HEART` ‚Üí Select `Cardiac`
	- üìù will take a while to load because there are so many images.
- We will begin by looking at the LV and RV size and function
	- LV: move your crosshairs to the _basal-mid_ of the LV with the crosshair pointing towards the apex of the LV in 2 planes
	- Press Play ‚Üí you‚Äôll see your 2 chamber, 4 chamber, and SAX views
- There is a button Dr. Hutt showed that estimates LVEF among the options on the right-side of the screen. 
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è As a sanity check, make sure that it is tracking well though.
- Next, look at the AV and assess open/close
- You will close the Multiphase series and load the `SYSTOLIC` and `CTA_CAP` series next. To open both you will hold `Ctrl` and select both ‚Üí Right click and select `HEART` ‚Üí 4D `TAVI`.

# [[Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)|TAVI]] "Landing Zone"

- The TAVI ‚Äúlanding zone‚Äù comprises the valve cusps, aortic annulus and LVOT.[^scct]
- The device landing zone is in close spatial relationship with the conduction system ‚ö° which may be compressed and damaged, causing **[[Atrioventricular Block|AV block]]** and need for pacemaker implantation especially in the context of severe calcification of the subannular device landing zone, with this effect amplified in the presence of pre-existent **[[Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB)]]**.[^scct]

## Calcium in the "Landing Zone"

- The presence of severe calcification of the [[Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT)|LVOT]] and [[Aortic Valve|aortic valve]] is associated with increased risk of paravalvular regurgitation particularly when calcium protrudes into the [[Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT)|LVOT]].[^scct]
- The region below the non-coronary and the left coronary cusps, including the intervalvular fibrosa, is most frequently affected.[^scct]
	- ![[How to Read a TAVI Scan-20241220132809518.webp|425]]
- In clinical practice, the description of annular (within annular plane) and sub-annular (upper 4‚Äì5mm of the LVOT where device gets into contact) calcification is almost exclusively performed in a subjective, qualitative fashion graded as none, mild, moderate, severe based on the circumferential extent, the depth of extension inferiorly into the LVOT and the thickness of the calcification projecting radially into the LVOT.[^scct]
- Annular and sub-annular calcification should be described as crescent/flat/adherent or protruding as well as its relation to the aortic cusps.[^scct]
