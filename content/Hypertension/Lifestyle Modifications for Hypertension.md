- Weight control to maintain appropriate body weight (BMI <25 kg/m2) [^sihd]
	- weight loss of 10 kg typically results in a decrease in BP of 5 to 20 mm Hg
- **Diet**: alcohol moderation, sodium reduction, and emphasis on increased consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products
- Improved sleep üò¥
	- Insomnia combined with a short sleep duration (<5 hours, but not > 5 hours) is associated with a significantly increased risk of hypertension.[^thomas-calhoun]
- Exercise/Increased physical activity üèÉ
	- "Isometric exercises, which involve contracting muscles to hold the body in position without moving, are best for lowering resting blood pressure, according to [results](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2022-106503) from 270 randomized clinical trials involving 15 827 participants. After isometric exercises, which include activities such as wall squats, combined training tended to reduce blood pressure the most, followed by dynamic resistance training, aerobic exercise, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)."
