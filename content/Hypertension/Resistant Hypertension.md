- High BP despite concurrent use of **three** anti-hypertensive agents of different classes, one of which should be a diuretic
- "True" Resistant HTN is defined as "Failure to reach goal BP <130/80 mm Hg while documenting ingestion of three-drug antihypertensive regimen including *an appropriate diuretic for kidney function*, a CCB and a RAS blocker maximally dosed"

# Diagnosis

- All of the following need to be present before diagnosing someone as having TRUE resistant hypertension
	- Adherence with: Low Sodium Diet Intake and Medication
	- Good Sleep Quality (i.e., minimum of 6-7 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night)
	- Substitutions of drugs with greater effect within the Same Class i.e. ARBs and diuretics
	- Rule out all Secondary Causes of Hypertension
		- Before saying anyone is resistant must rule out the most common secondary cause of hypertension: **Primary Hyperaldosteronism** ([prevalence is high and largely unrecognized](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32449886/))
