Lagrangian strain is defined as the change in length of an object within a certain direction relative to its baseline length:
$$
\text{Strain(\%)} = \frac{L_t - L_0}{L_0}
$$

where $L_{t}$ is the length at time $t$, and $L_{0}$ is the initial length at time 0. 

The most commonly used strain-based measure of LV global systolic function is GLS, which is usually assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE). On 2DE, peak GLS describes the relative length change of the LV myocardium between end-diastole and end-systole:

$$
\text{GLS(\%)} = \frac{ML_s - ML_d}{ML_d}
$$
where $ML$ is myocardial length at end-systole ($ML_s$) and end-diastole ($ML_d$). Because $ML_s$ is smaller than $ML_d$, peak GLS is a *negative* number.

- GLS measurements should be made in the three standard apical views, i.e. A4C, A2C, A3C, and averaged.
- ⚠️ When regional tracking is suboptimal in more than two myocardial segments in a single view, the calculation of GLS should be avoided.
	- In such cases, alternative indices may be used to gain insight into longitudinal LV function, such as mitral annular plane systolic excursion or pulsed Doppler tissue imaging (DTI)-derived mitral annular peak systolic velocity (s').
