# Standard Views

- The 2013 ASE Guidelines proposed 4 standard views, but the updated guidelines for Structural included a 5th: [^ase-struc]
	- upper esophageal (UE)
	- midesophageal (ME)
	- transgastric (TG)
	- deep transgastric (DT)
	- deep esophageal (DE) - ðŸ†•
		- between the ME and TG levels, which is particularly useful for imaging [[Right Ventricle|right heart]] structures

# Simultaneous Multiplane Imaging ("2 for 1")

- Simultaneous multiplane imaging permits the use of a dual screen to simultaneously display two real-time 2D images.

# Understanding Angles âˆ 

- At a transducer angle of 0Ëš (the horizontal or transverse plane), with the imaging plane directed anteriorly from the esophagus through the heart, the patientâ€™s right side appears in the left of the image display
	- Turning the probe to the left (counterclockwise) allows imaging of primarily the left heart structures. Turning the probe to the right (clockwise) allows imaging of primarily right heart structures.
	- ![[Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)-20241223133938262.webp|448]]
- Rotating the transducer angle forward to 90Ëš(vertical or longitudinal plane) moves the left side of the display inferiorly toward the spine.
	- ![[Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)-20241223134102041.webp|421]]
- Rotating the transducer angle to 180Ëš places the patientâ€™s left side to the left of the display, i.e. the mirror image of 0Ëš.
