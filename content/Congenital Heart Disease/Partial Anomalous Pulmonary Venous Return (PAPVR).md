- Normally, the four pulmonary vv. are return oxygenated blood into the LA. In the case of PAPVR, you have _one or more_ pulmonary veins dumping oxygenated blood into the systemic venous system (usually RA, SVC, or IVC).
- Most commonly, PAPVRs involve the:
	- LUPV (left upper pulmonary vein) → ascending vertical vein → innominate vein *or* 
	- RUPV → SVC
		- This type is often associated with a concurrent sinus venosus defect connecting the RA and LA
- Scimitar syndrome is a subtype of PAPVR in which part or all of the blood from the right lung is returned into the IVC.
